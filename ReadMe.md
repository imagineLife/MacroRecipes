## Summary
This is for finding recipes based on macronutrient values (i.e protein, fat, and carbohydrates) and ingredients.
This answers questions like :<br /><br />
*'How can I get 20 grams of protein with some chicken and tomatoes?'*
*'What can I make with cumin, beef, and onions that is no more than 300 calories?'*<br /><br />

**Motivation**<br />
I wanted to help some health-concious friends.<br />
I wanted to develop a mobile-first app to quickly get the job done while someone is looking through their refrigerator without a clear plan of what food to prepare.<br />
*NOTE:* Calories have been added as a quick-view nutritional element. Calories are of high value to the health-consious eater.
