## Synopsis


## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This is for finding recipes based on macronutrient values (i.e protein, fat, and carbohydrates) and ingredients.
'How can I get 20 grams of protein with some chicken and tomatoes?'
'What can I make with cumin, beef, and onions that is no more than 300 calories?'
